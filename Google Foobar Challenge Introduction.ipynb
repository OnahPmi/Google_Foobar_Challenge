    "Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on their space station. From here, you just might be able to subvert Commander Lambda's plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...\n",

    "You survived a week in Commander Lambda's organization, and you even managed to get yourself promoted. Hooray! Henchmen still don't have the kind of security access you'll need to take down Commander Lambda, though, so you'd better keep working. Chop chop!\n",
    "\n",
    "The perks are definitely better as a Henchman than as a Minion. You're even allowed to sleep lying down!\n",

    "The latest gossip in the henchman breakroom is that \"LAMBCHOP\" stands for \"Lambda's Anti-Matter Biofuel Collision Hadron Oxidating Potentiator\". You're pretty sure it runs on diesel, not biofuel, but you can at least give the commander credit for trying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Awesome! Commander Lambda was so impressed by your efforts that you've been promoted to personal assistant. You'll be helping the Commander directly, which means you'll have access to all of Lambda's files -- including the ones on the LAMBCHOP doomsday device. This is the chance you've been waiting for. Can you use your new access to finally topple Commander Lambda's evil empire?\n",
